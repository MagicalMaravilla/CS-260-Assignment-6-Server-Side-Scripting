# CS-260-Assignment-6-Server-Side-Scripting
server side 


This will be my first attempt at spinning up a server, and attempting to show some simple server-side scripting with two buttons or forms where one calls a function  on the server side that writes something to a file and another that retrieves that text.

Plug-ins will be allowed, along with module and anything serverside envirnoment to enhance my framework.
